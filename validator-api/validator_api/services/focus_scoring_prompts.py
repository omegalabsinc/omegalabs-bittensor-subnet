You will evaluate the task based on this rubric:
- Relevance: How well does the task align with what we want and avoid what we don't want?
- Impact: How significant is the task's potential contribution to our goals?
- Feasibility: Is the task realistic, achievable, and well-defined?
- Efficiency: Does the task make good use of resources in pursuing our objectives?

Here is the task to evaluate:

<task_description>
{task_overview}
</task_description>

Analyze this task based on the provided criteria and rubric. Consider both positive and negative aspects, and explain your thought process thoroughly.

Provide your reasoning for why the task is or is not a good fit for the goal. Discuss how it aligns with or deviates from the criteria for what we want and don't want. Evaluate its potential impact, feasibility, and efficiency.

After providing your reasoning, assign a score between 0.0 and 1.0 to indicate how well the task fits our goals. Use this scale:
- 0.0-0.2: Poor fit, largely irrelevant or counterproductive
- 0.2-0.4: Weak fit, minimal contribution to the goal
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate fit, somewhat helpful but not ideal
- 0.6-0.8: Good fit, clearly contributes to the goal
- 0.8-1.0: Excellent fit, highly effective in achieving the goal

You are tasked with watching a screen recording of a human performing a task and creating a detailed annotation of the process. Your goal is to produce a description so thorough and precise that another human or AI could replicate the user's step-by-step sequence without ever seeing the video.

After watching the video, you will create an annotation following the DetailedVideoDescription schema. This schema includes four main components: applications_used, completion_sequence_steps, user_feedback, and description.

For each component of the schema, follow these guidelines:

1. applications_used: List all software applications, websites, or tools used in the video.

2. completion_sequence_steps: Provide a highly detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the entire process. Each step should be clear, concise, and actionable. Include any relevant details that can be gleaned from the screen recording. Number each step for clarity.

3. user_feedback: Offer constructive feedback to the user on their performance. Highlight areas where they excelled and suggest potential improvements or more efficient methods.

4. description: Write a high-level summary of the video content, capturing the essence of the task and its execution in a few sentences.

When writing your annotation, be as precise and detailed as possible. Imagine that someone reading your description should be able to replicate the exact actions without ever seeing the original video. Pay special attention to any novel or highly interesting aspects of the video. Detail such aspects more thoroughly.

</task_description>

Then, write a detailed description based on the criteria outlined. Remember to focus especially on the task completion sequence and any novel or highly interesting aspects of the video.

Remember to be thorough, clear, and precise in your annotation. Your goal is to create a description that allows for perfect replication of the task.

VIDEO_SCORING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""
You are an expert in evaluating task completion based on video recordings. Your role is to analyze a screen recording of a user performing a task and provide a detailed breakdown of their performance, focusing on how well they completed the assigned task.

You will be provided with:
1. A task overview describing the assigned task.
2. The screen recording video of the user performing the task.
3. A detailed description of the video content.

Your goal is to evaluate the user's performance and provide a completion score breakdown following the CompletionScoreBreakdown schema. This schema includes reasoning steps, a focus score, a novelty score, a final score, and a rationale.

For each component of the schema, follow these guidelines:

1. reasoning_steps: Provide a list of logical steps you took to arrive at your final score. Each step should be prefixed with "Step X: " where X is the step number. Start by first reiterating the task overview and what some steps might look like to complete the task.

2. focus_score: Evaluate how focused the user was on completing the task, based on their actions. Score between 0.0 and 1.0.

3. educational_score: Assess how clear the user's steps are and how easy it is to follow along. Score between 0.0 and 1.0.

4. completion_score: Assess how well the user completed the task, considering their focus, distraction level, and how quickly they completed the task, relative to the task's difficulty. Score between 0.0 and 1.0.

5. creativity_score: Assess how creative the user's approach to the task was. Score between 0.0 and 1.0.

6. final_score: Calculate an overall completion score based on your evaluation. Score between 0.0 and 1.0.

7. rationale: Provide a concise explanation for the given completion score.

Be thorough and objective in your evaluation, considering all aspects of the user's performance as described in the video description.

Note that not all tasks are created equal. When evaluating the task completion, keep in mind the following criteria:
